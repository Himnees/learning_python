# Assignment Operators
a = 10
a += 5 # add 5 assign the result to a (same as a = a+5)
b = 20 
b -= 10 # subtract 10 and assign the result to b (same as b = b - 10)
c = 5
c *= 2 # Multiply with 2 and assign the result to c (same as c = c * 2)
d = 20
d /= 2 # Divide by 2 and assign the result to d (same as d = d/2) returns the result in float type
e = 20
e //= 2 # Divide by 2 and assign the result to e (same as e = e//2) returns the result in int type
